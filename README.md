# Week-1---Python-Problem-Solving-

I'm thrilled to share a notebook of "Python for Programming" course at the foundational level offered by IITM. This week's journey covered a range of fundamental topics that are essential for any budding programmer:



🖥️ **Print Statements**: Mastering the basics of output in Python.



💡 **Variables**: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.



🔡 **Input Statements**: Learning how to take user inputs effectively.



🔢 **Literals and Datatypes**: Differentiating between various data types and their significance.



➕ **Operators and Expressions**: Using operators to perform calculations and logical operations.



📝 **Strings**: Exploring string manipulation and operations.



To solidify my understanding, I've created a Jupyter notebook compiling both practice and graded assignments from these topics. This notebook serves as a valuable resource for revision and future reference.
